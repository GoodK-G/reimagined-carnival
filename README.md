# reimagined-carnival

## Description

Here is my portfolio, I built this to show to future employers and co-workers.
I built this mainly to display my programs that I have created, and projects that i will create in the future.
I learned alot about css while making this, and using the flex properties.
Making cards for the individual images was difficult for me, but now i know how to do it.

## Usage

There is a navigation bar at the top of the application that will bring you to the corrisponding sections.
Also, at the bottom of the page is ways to contact me.
You are able to click on different images to be directed to the deployed application.
